Title: Visualising Category Recoding Graphs in Data Harmonisation
Time: Tue Oct 22, 2-3pm
Location: ICCS/CS Bldg, Room X836

Speaker: Cynthia Huang, Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics, Monash Business School (visiting PhD student)

Abstract:  We discuss graphical representations of data and rationale provenance in workflows that convert both category labels and associated numeric data between distinct but semantically related taxonomies. We motivate the graphical representations with a new task abstraction, the "crossmap transform", and associated graph-based information structure, the "crossmap". The task abstraction supports the separation of category recoding and numeric redistribution decisions from the specifics of data manipulation in ex-post data harmonisation. The crossmap structure is illustrated using an example conversion of numeric statistics from a country-specific taxonomy to an international classification standard. We discuss the opportunities and challenges of using visualisation to audit and communicate cross-taxonomy transformations and present candidate graphical representations.
