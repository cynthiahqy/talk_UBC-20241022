  abstract = {Multiverse analyses involve conducting all combinations of reasonable choices in a data analysis process. A reader of a study containing a multiverse analysis might question---are all the choices included in the multiverse reasonable and equally justifiable? How much do results vary if we make different choices in the analysis process? In this work, we identify principles for validating the composition of, and interpreting the uncertainty in, the results of a multiverse analysis. We present Milliways, a novel interactive visualisation system to support principled evaluation of multiverse analyses. Milliways provides interlinked panels presenting result distributions, individual analysis composition, multiverse code specification, and data summaries. Milliways supports interactions to sort, filter and aggregate results based on the analysis specification to identify decisions in the analysis process to which the results are sensitive. To represent the two qualitatively different types of uncertainty that arise in multiverse analyses---probabilistic uncertainty from estimating unknown quantities of interest such as regression coefficients, and possibilistic uncertainty from choices in the data analysis---Milliways uses consonance curves and probability boxes. Through an evaluative study with five users familiar with multiverse analysis, we demonstrate how Milliways can support multiverse analysis tasks, including a principled assessment of the results of a multiverse analysis.},

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

Data processing often involves choices among several reasonable options for excluding, transforming, and coding data. We suggest that instead of performing only one analysis, researchers could perform a multiverse analysis, which involves performing all analyses across the whole set of alternatively processed data sets corresponding to a large set of reasonable scenarios. Using an example focusing on the effect of fertility on religiosity and political attitudes, we show that analyzing a single data set can be misleading and propose a multiverse analysis as an alternative practice. A multiverse analysis offers an idea of how much the conclusions change because of arbitrary choices in data construction and gives pointers as to which choices are most consequential in the fragility of the result.},

However, understanding intricate code pieces requires advanced programming skills, which hinders data workers from grasping the idea of data transformation at ease. Program visualization is beneficial for debugging and education and has the potential to illustrate transformations intuitively and interactively. In this paper, we explore visualization design for demonstrating the semantics of code pieces in the context of data transformation. First, to depict individual data transformations, we structure a design space by two primary dimensions, i.e., key parameters to encode and possible visual channels to be mapped. Then, we derive a collection of 23 glyphs that visualize the semantics of transformations. Next, we design a pipeline, named Somnus, that provides an overview of the creation and evolution of data tables using a provenance graph. At the same time, it allows detailed investigation of individual transformations. User feedback on Somnus is positive. Our study participants achieved better accuracy with less time using Somnus, and preferred it over carefully-crafted textual description. Further, we provide two example applications to demonstrate the utility and versatility of Somnus.},

As different choices can lead to diverging conclusions, understanding how researchers make analytic decisions is important for supporting robust and replicable analysis. In this study, we pore over nine published research studies and conduct semi-structured interviews with their authors. We observe that researchers often base their decisions on methodological or theoretical concerns, but subject to constraints arising from the data, expertise, or perceived interpretability. We confirm that researchers may experiment with choices in search of desirable results, but also identify other reasons why researchers explore alternatives yet omit findings. In concert with our interviews, we also contribute visualizations for communicating decision processes throughout an analysis. Based on our results, we identify design opportunities for strengthening end-to-end analysis, for instance via tracking and meta-analysis of multiple decision paths.},

  abstract = {Though data analysis tools continue to improve, analysts still expend an inordinate amount of time and effort manipulating data and assessing data quality issues. Such ``data wrangling'' regularly involves reformatting data values or layout, correcting erroneous or missing values, and integrating multiple data sources. These transforms are often difficult to specify and difficult to reuse across analysis tasks, teams, and tools. In response, we introduce Wrangler, an interactive system for creating data transformations. Wrangler combines direct manipulation of visualized data with automatic inference of relevant transforms, enabling analysts to iteratively explore the space of applicable operations and preview their effects. Wrangler leverages semantic data types (e.g., geographic locations, dates, classification codes) to aid validation and type conversion. Interactive histories support review, refinement, and annotation of transformation scripts. User study results show that Wrangler significantly reduces specification time and promotes the use of robust, auditable transforms instead of manual editing.},

A diverse set of stakeholders\textemdash representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers\textemdash have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},
